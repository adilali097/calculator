To create a simple calculator program in C that can be compiled and run on Termux, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Termux and install the necessary packages:

```bash
pkg update
pkg upgrade
pkg install git
pkg install clang
```

2. Clone the calculator repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adilali097/calculator.git
cd calculator
```

3. Open the calculator.c file using a text editor:

```bash
nano calculator.c
```

4. Copy and paste the following C code into the calculator.c file:

```c

```

5. Save the changes and exit the text editor (in Nano, you can press `Ctrl` + `X`, then `Y`, and finally `Enter`).

6. Compile the C program:

```bash
clang calculator.c -o calculator
```

7. Run the calculator:

```bash
./calculator
```

Now, you should be able to use the calculator program within Termux. Follow the prompts to enter an operator and two numbers, and the program will display the result.
